# macOS - Dotfiles

This is my config for my macOS terminal where I mainly use alacritty and tmux. I have uploaded a .sh file that you can *chmod +x* and run if you want to download the packages I use for my setup 

For securing parallel updating between my real-time config and this dotfiles repo, I use stow (https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
